\section{\label{sec:fazit}Conclusion}
Overall, in this experiment, we gained a comprehensive insight into dark-field microscopy 
and the nature of plasmons. 
Taking charge of the alignment ourselves, experimenting with optical instruments allowed 
us to develop a sense of their influence on the overall setup. 
The alignment of the dark-field microscope went smoothly, thanks to the excellent preparation 
by our supervisor, making the entire experiment enjoyable. 
The addition of the spectrometer to the experiment was well-explained, 
and due to its relatively simple setup, we accomplished this step quickly. \\
The qualitative and quantitative measurements we recorded are clear and, upon analysis, 
yield satisfactory results within the expected range. 
The proper correction of the measured spectra played a crucial role in our evaluation, 
as inaccuracies in this process could lead to errors. 
We would recommend incorporating a section in the experimental manual that provides 
a more detailed explanation of spectrum correction and emphasizes its significance. 
The key points for this are outlined in the preparatory question \ref{subsec:FZV6}. \\
We reiterate the importance of this aspect as the incorrectly corrected spectra appeared 
more aesthetically pleasing but resulted in significantly different final outcomes. \\
In summary, we enjoyed the experiment, learned a lot, and appreciated the excellent guidance we received.
